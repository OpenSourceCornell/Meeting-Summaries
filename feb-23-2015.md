It was great meeting everyone today!  I'm going to start sending out meeting summaries just so we remember what's going on.

1. If you are interested in giving a talk, shoot an email to open-source-cornell-officials@googlegroups.com.  Let us know what the topic would be, roughly when you would be able to give the talk, and anything else you want us to know.  We will try to host a lightning talk in next week's meeting; the topic is to be decided.

2. If you are interested in developing the new CMS and you haven't done so during the meeting, shoot an email to ej222@cornell.edu (yes my official name is Enchi Jiang; sorry for the confusion) with your name.  Remember, you can optionally get credits for this.

3. A summary of our communication channels:

* Mailing list: cornell-opensource@freeculture.org
* Mailing list for the officials: open-source-cornell-officials@googlegroups.com
* IRC: #opensourcecornell on freenode
* Facebook group: ask Patrick (pmn25)

We will post all announcements such as this to the mailing list and the facebook group.
