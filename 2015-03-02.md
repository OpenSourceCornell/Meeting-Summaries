It was fun meeting everyone today.  First thing first, as Genki suggested, if you are running or contributing to some open-source projects, please fill in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CFEVYVSfB491EiVrOoUB1gbWaY40onnpCeyjvDxZW0A/edit#gid=0) so people can help!

-----------------------------------

Today Patrick talked about the ins and outs of contributing to an open-source project.  Here is a summary of our discussion:

* Different projects have different contribution processes: they use different version control tools, they host their code differently, they have different review processes, etc.  It's therefore important to find out exactly what the process is before contributing to a project.  Some ways to do it include:

1. Check out the project's website, if it has one.  For instance, [this page](https://docs.python.org/devguide/) details the process of contributing to Python.  As another example, this Github wiki [page](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/wiki/Note-guide-for-new-contributors) tells you how to contribute to Rust.

2. Ask on the project's IRC channel, if it has one.  Something as simple as "Hey, I want to contribute to this project.  Can someone tell me how to get started?" will do.

Most of the small open-source projects in the wild do not have a very formal contribution process, however.  For instance, if you want to contribute to a random repo on Github, then it's usually just a matter of submitting [pull-requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).  Do make sure to read the project's README file first though, as it might contain instructions.

* Different projects have different cultures.  For instance, the Linux kernel maintainers (led by Linus Torvalds, of course) are known to be kinda rude and hostile to new contributors.  Therefore, it's important to 1) not take it personally if people get rude at you, as they might just not have the time to be too polite, and 2) not to be rude to contributors to your own projects, as they are just trying to help.

Ways to learn about a project's culture include hanging out in their IRC channel, looking at their mailing list, etc.

-----------------------------------

Lastly, some people suggested that we code together over the weekend or something.  If you ever feel like working on open-source stuff and you want some companions, just post on our Facebook group or shoot an email to the mailing list (some people like me don't use Facebook)!

If you are not on our Github team, send your Github username to ej222 so I can add you.

If you want to work on the new CMS, shoot an email to ej222.

The meeting next week will be at the same time at the same place.  There will be a separate email for that.

Good luck with prelims!
