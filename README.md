# Meeting Summaries

Summaries of our regular meetings.

Also, we will put things that we are planning to discuss on the document for the upcoming week.  For instance, at the time of writing, the March 9 meeting is coming up, so we put things that we want to discuss there.  **If there is anything at all that you want to discuss, be sure to edit the document to put it in!**

## How to contribute

The simplest way would be to use the browser-based editor that Github provides.  So just click on the document you want to modify, then click the little pen sign on the upper right corner, and start editing.
