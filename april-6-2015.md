Introductions
-------------

As is customary, we did introductions again, which were hopefully
useful to our new members, going around the table clockwise, and we
learned everyone's name, what everyone did over break, how everyone
got involved in Open Source, and what everyone's favorite David Bowie
song is.  There will be a short quiz next week.

CMS
---

Things are happening, I think.  There will probably be an email going
out to interested parties.

Linux Installfest
-----------------

We have all the install media set, and a room is coming soon, so it'll
hopefully be this week or coming week.

General Discussion
------------------

We spent 48 minutes talking about diverse topics that included single
page sites, CS3110, MIPS, Natural Language Processing, and game
engines.  The general consensus seemed to be that we should do this
unstructured sort of meeting more often.  Patrick was asked about how
to learn C++, which effectively killed all other conversation, and
after he lamented the lack of a good book that teaches it the way he
feels it should be taught, the meeting was adjourned.
