## SymPy

David Li gave a talk about [SymPy](http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html).  He walked through the major features and talked about how to contribute to the project.

The Jupyter/IPython Notebook used can be found [in this repository](https://github.com/OpenSourceCornell/Meeting-Summaries/blob/master/march-23-2015-lightning-talk-sympy.ipynb). They can be [viewed online](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/OpenSourceCornell/Meeting-Summaries/blob/master/march-23-2015-lightning-talk-sympy.ipynb) via nbviewer.
